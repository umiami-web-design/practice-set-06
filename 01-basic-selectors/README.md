## Introduction to CSS

### Instructions

As you go through each step, I recommend checking the code in Firefox. If something is incorrect, you will find the mistake easier to catch if there is less code to review.

*NOTE:* In this exercise, you will *only* use type, id and class selectors.

1. The file `constitution.html` is an abridged version of the U.S. Constitution, which has been marked up. Before starting, make sure the HTML in the file is [valid](https://validator.w3.org/) code. Never assume the code you receive in exercises is clean! :>

2. Note the use of `id` and `class`. The `id` attribute is used to identify the `preamble`, `articles` and `amendments`. A class of `bill-of-rights` has been applied to the first 10 amendments (otherwise known as the Bill of Rights).

4. Create a new directory in `01-basic-selectors` called `css`. Create a new style sheet in this directory named `style.css`. Link to the style sheet in `constitution.html`.

5. Set the `body` font to use a sans-serif typeface (i.e. `Helvetica` or `Arial`). Make the font color `#222`. Set the font size to 16 pixels.

6. Set the anchor (`a`) color to `rgb(233,87,80)`. Set the anchor's visited state (`a:visited`) to `rgb(15,97,165)`.

7. Set the `header` font size to 24 pixels.

8. Set the font style of the `nav` to italic.

9. Set the background color for the `preamble`, `articles` and `amendments` to be #eee.

10. Set the background color for the `bill-of-rights` articles to be `#ccc`.

11. When finished, check your [CSS Validator](jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). This will help identify missing semicolons/colons, curly braces, incorrect property names, etc. Note it is not foolproof: just because a "valid" rule is written to meet syntax requirements doesn't mean it will work with your site! :)
