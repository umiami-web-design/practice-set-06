## CSS: Descendent Selectors

### Instructions

As you go through each step, I recommend checking the code in Firefox. If something is incorrect, you will find the mistake easier to catch if there is less code to review.

*NOTE:* In this exercise, you will primarily use descendent selectors. The only exceptions to this are when you style `body`, `header` and `footer`.

Other than **correcting broken links, broken images or validation errors** or **adding a link to your style sheet**, you **MAY NOT** modify any of the HTML.

If instructions require you to use a property you haven't seen, look it up. Explore!

1. In `cat-computing.html`, make sure all links work, the images appear and the code validates. Do not continue to the next step until these are corrected. Never assume your HTML is valid! :)

2. Create a new directory called `css` inside `02-descendent-selectors`. Next, create a style sheet named `style.css`. Save this file within the `css` folder you just created. Link to the style sheet in `cat-computing.html`.

3. Set the `body` font size to 14 pixels, the font-family to a sans-serif typeface (you may choose to use a specific typeface or the generic default), font color to `#222` and the line height to 1.5.

4. Set the `header` to have a background color of `#eee`.

5. Set `em` tags within the `header` to have a font weight of bold.

6. Set `a` tags within the `header` to have a background color of `#eee` and a font color of `#444`. `a:visited` tags within `header` should have a background color of `#444` and the color should be `#eee`.

7. Within the `aside`, set `img` to have a border width of 3 pixels, a border style of `solid` and a border color of `#222`.

8. Set the `em` tags inside the aside to have a font style of `italic`, a font color of `#999` and a font size of 10 pixels.

9. Let's add some unique styles to each section. Under `#hardware`, the `h2` should have a font color of `rgb(218,58,51)`. Apply the same color the `img` border. Under `#software`, apply the same rules, but using the color `rgb(21,88,218)`.

10. Set the `footer` to have background color of `#222` and a font color of `#eee`.

11. Set `a` tags within the `footer` to have a font color of `#eee` and `a:visited` tags to have a font color of `#444`.

12. Set the `small` content inside `footer` to have a font size of 10 pixels.

13. When finished, check your [CSS Validator](jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). This will help identify missing semicolons/colons, curly braces, incorrect property names, etc. Note it is not foolproof: just because a "valid" rule is written to meet syntax requirements doesn't mean it will work with your site! :)

If you complete all these tasks, experiment with other selectors, properties to style the page as you see fit.
